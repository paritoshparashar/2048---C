# Edge Detection in C

## Overview

In this project, we will implement a C program that can detect edges within images. The goal is to find the borders between homogeneous areas of similar hues and grey-scale values. Detecting edges finds numerous applications in object detection, such as in self-driving cars, artistic image filters, or image compression algorithms. In section 2, we can find a high-level description of the edge detection algorithm. The appendix gives more technical information.
